## About the Project
This is a 2-day challenge project to build full-stack e-commerce site (School Project)

## Description
Bench Bakery is a microservices-based e-commerce web application that helps hungry people to order easily. I built both the front-end and back-end. For the front-end, I created the logo and designed the website with SEO friendly. For the back-end, I built client server architecture with REST APIs and stored procedures that connect to MySQL. In this application, the bakery owners can manage the website by CMS. They can add, update and delete a product onto the website.
