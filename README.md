## Overview
Bench Bakery is a microservices-based e-commerce web application that helps hungry people to order easily. I built both the front-end and back-end. For the front-end, I created the logo and designed the website. For the back-end, I built client server architecture with REST APIs and stored procedures that connect to MySQL. In this application, users can manage the website. They can upload products onto the site, update some information, and delete a product.
